    <h1>What caused all this mess</h1>
      <p>I stayed home at lockdown, bored out of my mind. Usually I had a friend that I would play games with, but we had a falling out due to an arguement surrounding Minecraft, dinnertime, and <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044149591-answering-parents-and-educators-top-questions#:~:text=If%20a%20user%20is%20reported,using%20an%20official%20ID%20document." target="_blank">threatening termination</a>. So, I decided to talk with an old friend of mine back in elementary school. His username was Jalabeanos.</p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>For context, during the lockdown of 2020, we made a group Discord server with all of the elementary students in my grade who decided to use Discord. We mostly talked about life, other students, memes, and a Discord bot that had its own little game with an economy. Then I invited a friend that I'll call Jalabeanos, who was a student at this school, into the server since it’s supposed to have all the students from my grade. However, he didn’t get along well in the Discord server, and was kicked out of there for being suspicious. Even though he wasn’t liked by a lot of the students on the server, he was still my good friend. So I decided to try and catch up with him, and my friends and I went on a wild ride.</p>
    <h1>Lots of funky stuff that happened: Part 1</h1>
      <p>Even though nothing initially happened once I got in touch with him, many weird things happened afterwards. Here is what happened in the first round of funk:</p>
    <h2>I got Doxxed! Sort of...</h2>
      <p>Jalabeanos started acting weird one day. He said he was gay, as in homosexual. While I’m fine with that, he wanted me to become gay with him. He then said that he was a “satanist” and wanted me to convert. Whether those were real claims or a way to make me uncomfortable, I wouldn’t know. However, here’s a kicker, he posted my personal information! It wasn’t that sensitive, like my mom’s credit card number, just stuff like the name I put for my phone, my postal code, and what internet service provider I use. That was enough to freak me out though. I went to my other 2 friends, who were classmates of my elementary school, for help, who I’ll call Red(another friend of mine) and Incognito(who was the Minecraft buddy). Because I was stuck in such a mess, where Jalabeanos could blackmail me and I couldn’t, my friends and I deliberated, and decided to “blackmail him back” by getting him to click on a phishing link(do not try this at home). We should’ve gone to a teacher or a counselor, but we were afraid that he would do something. </p>
      <h2>A Deal with the Devil, where the Devil makes you have to use Do Not Disturb</h2>
        <p>After getting him to back off, Jalabeanos said that we’ll make a deal, he doesn’t do anything and I don’t do anything(I threw his personal information away, don’t tell him). In order for us to conduct this truce, he wanted me to join his server, which showed evil and edgy “Grah I love satan!!” imagery in it. From my personal experience, the server was garbage. He went on and spammed this imagery, as well as images of a homosexual acts, and said things of the same sort. It’s a good thing the “mute server" button exists on Discord! Apparently my friend Red went on this server too in order to confront him. He had roughly the same experience as me.</p>
      <h1>Even Wackier Stuff that Also Happened: Part 2</h1>
        <p>This is an even wackier continuation of the saga, which happened after part 1. I wished I could make an "electric boogaloo" joke here, but alas, the title would be too long for no reason.</p>
      <h2>Impersonation, Imitation, and Roleplay Kidnap</h2>
        <p>One day, I received a message from Incognito, worried. He said that Red thought that I was in danger, and that <em>someone broke into my house</em>. Obviously this was not true, I was perfectly fine on my couch that day. I went to go ask him if he said this. Red said that he said that, since he thought that a fake account was me. That fake account was pretending to be me and talking to Red, saying that I was violated by Jalabeanos, and that he did bad things to his sister. He then proceeded to act out a scenario where he kidnaps me by breaking into my house. If not for the fact that the account claimed that the account I used was defunct, I don’t think that would’ve been believable. Given how specific that fake account went to impersonate me as well as talk about Jalabeanos, I’d say that that account has something to do with this whole conundrum. </p>
      <h2>A Less Wacky but More Scary Thing, My School Account Getting Hacked</h2>
        <p>On a more serious but scary note, during this whole situation, that was the only time I’ve ever changed my school account’s password. Once, I received an email from my account, and it was about how a new computer was signed into my school account. I went and checked, and saw the horrifying words: Windows from Argentina(this would make a good two sentence horror story). Now, as the boy who didn’t understand and didn’t want to cause a fuss, I assumed that it was the school district doing that, and that they do routine checks on student accounts. I wasn’t confident in this answer though, so I went and double checked with the counselor by sending her an email. However, while I was waiting for a response, I went to check the thread I made with her on my gmail, and saw this:</p>
        <img width="1917" alt="That wasn't me" src="https://github.com/thegoodoldj/The_Story_About_Discord_Doxxing_and_Jalapeno_Beans/assets/145703171/e6d36496-61e1-43fc-9225-41bf4ce51612">
        <p>Obviously that wasn’t me, and I was quickly snapped back to reality. I went and did the procedure that Google gave me if the new computer wasn’t mine, and changed my password as quickly as I could. It’s a good thing the hacker didn’t change the password before I did, otherwise that would be devastating. With how many other things happening that month, I can only assume that this also was associated with what is going on(the school account passwords are pretty easy to crack if you know what a student’s birthday is and they haven’t changed the password). </p>
      <h1>Aftermath</h1>
        <p>Eventually, we decided that it would probably be best if we told our authorities. I went on a call with my school counselor, and spilt all the beans, through recounting and through screenshots. Red went and contacted a teacher from our elementary school so that the situation could be handled over there as well. All of this was finally over.</p>
      <h2>That Doesn't Stop Me from Theorizing Though</h2>
        <p>At the end, I never got to figure out why this happened, as well as who caused it. Many people would say that it was Jalabeanos who caused this who mess, but as a person who was a good friend to him, I wanted to think otherwise. So, let's think about whodunit.</p>
        <h3>Was it Jalabeanos(Himself)?</h3>
          <p>Despite me wanting to believe that Jalabeanos didn’t do these vile deeds, there’s much evidence that supports it. Many of my classmates in the old elementary school server said that he was sus, and he was also booted off of it. Not only that, but during my conversations with him during that whole debacle, he mentioned a classmate we had back in our old elementary school, and how he “threw [Jalabeanos] under the bus.” Before Jalabeanos, that classmate was also a sort of bad type as well, where once he went onto an alternate account and pretended to be a hacker that knows all of our personal information(I knew it was him when he did that). The most damning of all, however, is how Jalabeanos also used his school email account to talk with us. On multiple occasions, Jalabeanos used his school email to talk with Red and Incognito about my situation with him. This shows that he is aware of what is happening on Discord. </p>
    <img width="698" alt="Jalabeanos uses his email? Why?" src="https://github.com/thegoodoldj/The_Story_About_Discord_Doxxing_and_Jalapeno_Beans/assets/145703171/f227fac8-4f97-4e93-bb76-e7a93c57de98">
        <h3>Was it my friend Incognito?</h3>
          <p>While I doubt it, Jalabeanos blamed Incognito for being the one doing all this, as he’s done through emails with Incognito, as well as through a Roblox game chat. I know that he’s a bit tech savvy in terms of playing with codes and tokens, but I doubt that Incognito would do this, considering the consequences of those actions. </p>
        <h3>Was it a Secret Third Thing?</h3>
          <p>Perhaps it is none of them? Maybe Jalabeanos(who is known to use free robux sites) was compromised entirely by a hacker who wanted to have fun and toy with a few children’s minds. It could explain why Jalabeanos acted consistently this way though the situation, and why Jalabeanos might think that Incognito did it(they were on bad terms). This is the one that I hope is true, as I still would like Jalabeanos as a friend and Incognito to also be a friend. However, I subconsciously know that Jalabeanos was probably the one who did all of this. I hope nothing like this "friendship breaker" ever happens again. Lesson of the day? I don't think <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/beanos" target="_blank">beanos</a> is funny.</p>
